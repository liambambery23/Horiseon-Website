# Horiseon-Website

## Description
The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing code of the Horiseon Marketing website. The following changes were made to accomplish this:

* Added alt tags to all images to meet accessibility standards and promote search engine optimization
* Ensured that all links functioned properly and fixed any that were broken
* Added comments to the CSS file detailing the function of the various elements
* Consolidated tags in the CSS file that were redundant 
* Added semantic tags in the HTML where possible
* Gave the webpage a title of "Horiseon Marketing"

## Motivation
My motiviation for this project was to leave the code better than when I found it, primarily by adding comments, consolidating tags, and adding accessibility standards to promote search engine optimization.
